          <figcaption>It takes several ingredients to create a delicious blog.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>It has been exactly 3 years since I wrote my first blog series entitled “Flavorful Tuscany”, but starting it was definitely not easy. Back then, I didn’t know much about blogging, let alone think that one day it could become <strong>my full-time job</strong>. Even though I had many recipes and food-related stories to tell, it never crossed my mind that I could be sharing them with the whole world</p>
        <p>I am now a <strong>full-time blogger</strong> and the curator of the <a href="https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-4/#">Simply delicious newsletter</a>, sharing stories about traveling and cooking, as well as tips on how to run a successful blog.</p>
        <p>If you are tempted by the idea of creating your own blog, please think about the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your story (what do you want to tell your audience)</li>
          <li>Your audience (who do you write for)</li>
          <li>Your blog name and design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After you get your head around these 3 essentials, all you have to do is grab your keyboard and the rest will follow.</p>
